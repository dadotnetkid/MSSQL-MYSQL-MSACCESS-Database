How to use Mysql && MSaccess && MSSQL
first this first is to download my API and add to your reference
c#
using Reverse.Data.Mysql;

MySqlDatabase db = new MySqlDatabase();
db.Connection = "";//your connection
//insert update delete on your tables
db.ExecuteNonQuery("insert into table1(field1,field2) values(@0,@1)", "Values1", "Values2");
 db.ExecuteNonQuery("update table1 set field1=@0,field2=@1", "Values1", "Values2");
 // if you see the @ sign there that is a parameter and the values1,values1 are the values or data to be update and to be inserted like textbox1.text etc
 
 //getting all data in your database to your datagridview
 datagridview1.datasource= db.ExecuteQuery("select * from table1")//execute query has two overrides one has a parametervalues and the other one doesnt have
 datagridview1.datasource=db.ExecuteQuery("select * from table1 where field1=@0","values1")//
 
 //getting one value only using scalar
 //executescalar has also two overrides
 int count=(int)db.ExecuteScalar("select count(t.field1) from table1 as t");
 int count=(int)db.ExecuteScalar("select count(t.field1) from table1 as t where t.field2=@0","Values1");
 VB.net
 Dim db As New MySqlDatabase
 db.Connection=""//your connection here
 db.ExecuteNonQuery("insert into table1(field1,field2) values(@0,@1)", "Values1", "Values2");
 db.ExecuteNonQuery("update table1 set field1=@0,field2=@1", "Values1", "Values2");
 //
 datagridview1.datasource= db.ExecuteQuery("select * from table1")//execute query has two overrides one has a parametervalues and the other one doesnt have
 datagridview1.datasource=db.ExecuteQuery("select * from table1 where field1=@0","values1")//
 
 dim count as int=db.ExecuteScalar("select count(t.field1) from table1 as t");
 dim count as int=db.ExecuteScalar("select count(t.field1) from table1 as t where t.field2=@0","Values1");
